Hello, I am Tanvi Bhole, a BBA Decision Science graduate from CHRIST University, Bengaluru. As a part of my curriculum, I also had the unique opportunity to work as a Student Apprentice at MuSigma, seamlessly integrating academic learning with industry experience. My passion lies in data visualization and business intelligence, where I aim to deliver insight-driven solutions that empower businesses to make informed decisions.

With a solid foundation in solving business challenges through statistical and visual analysis, I am adept at transforming data into actionable insights. While I am proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, and skilled in data visualization tools like PowerBI and Tableau, my true interest lies in leveraging these tools to create meaningful visualizations and drive business strategies.

My experience extends to working with databases using Microsoft SQL and having a conceptual understanding of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I have a foundational knowledge of NodeJS, Hadoop, Hive, and data engineering pipelines.

I am dedicated to use data to foster business growth and deliver value to stakeholders. As a detail-oriented and hardworking individual, I strive to exceed expectations and deliver high-quality work.
